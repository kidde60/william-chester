  <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. <p>There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; </p>I like to talk, I like to. listenI like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.</p> <code>
